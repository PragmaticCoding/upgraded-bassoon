## Demystifying Pseudo Classes in JavaFX

Pseudo Classes are the best way to handle on/off state changes in a Node in JavaFX.  But it's very badly explained in the JavaDocs and hard to understand.  This article should clear that up.

# What's a PseudoClass?

Have you ever noticed how a `Button` changes a little when you hover your mouse over it?  Or darkens to look like it's pressed down when you hold down a mouse button in it?  These presentation changes are usually accomplished through the use of `PseudoClasses`.

`PseudoClasses` are specialized CSS selectors which represent on/off states of some value of a `Node`.  One or more aspects of the styling of a `Node` will be changed when the `PseudoClass` is turned on, and then returned back to their original state when the `PseudoClass` is turned off again.  

They're useful because the styling is all handled for you behind the scenes.  The normal use case is to tie the `PseudoClass` state to a `Boolean Property`, and then bind that `Property` to a `Property` in the Model or some other part of the GUI.  Sometimes the `PseudoClass` state is control by `EventHandlers`.

## Built-In PseudoClasses

There are a number of predefined `PseudoClasses` in JavaFX that you can use without any special programming.  For instance, many controls have a `disabled` pseudo class which is automatically maintained for you whenever the control's `Disabled` property changes.  

The standard Modena CSS has definitions like this:

``` css
.spinner:disabled {
    -fx-opacity: 0.4;
}
```

You can override these in your own stylesheets to make the control behave differently when it's disabled.

## Create Your Own PseudoClass

The built-in `PseudoClasses` are useful, but sometimes you need to create your own `PseudoClass` to handle state changes in ways unique to your application.  For instance, you might want to change the colour of a `Label` if the data it displays indicates an error condition.

This article is about how to create a brand new `PseudoClass` and how to link it into your screen `Node` so that you can style it via your CSS.

# The JavaDocs for Pseudoclass are Horrible

If you want to look, you can find them [here](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/16/javafx.graphics/javafx/css/PseudoClass.html).

The introduction at the top reads like this:

> PseudoClass represents one unique pseudo-class state. Introducing a pseudo-class into a JavaFX class only requires that the method Node.pseudoClassStateChanged(javafx.css.PseudoClass, boolean) be called when the pseudo-class state changes. Typically, the pseudoClassStateChanged method is called from the protected void invalidated() method of one of the property base classes in the javafx.beans.property package.<br><br>Note that if a node has a default pseudo-class state, a horizontal orientation for example, pseudoClassStateChanged should be called from the constructor to set the initial state.<br><br>
The following example would allow "xyzzy" to be used as a pseudo-class in a CSS selector.

Yikes!  That doesn't really explain anything unless you already understand it.

And then they've included the following example code:

``` java
  public boolean isMagic() {
       return magic.get();
   }

   public BooleanProperty magicProperty() {
       return magic;
   }

   public BooleanProperty magic =
       new BooleanPropertyBase(false) {

       @Override protected void invalidated() {
           pseudoClassStateChanged(MAGIC_PSEUDO_CLASS, get());
       }

       @Override public Object getBean() {
           return MyControl.this;
       }

       @Override public String getName() {
           return "magic";
       }
   }

   private static final PseudoClass
       MAGIC_PSEUDO_CLASS = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("xyzzy");

```

Seriously, I don't think this is a great way to explain how it works.  They've even called it `magicProperty`, which might be an admission that they understood they weren't explaining it very well when they wrote it.

Not to mention that `MyControl.this` is never defined anywhere.  Also, there's a typo (which I've fixed here) in the call to `pseudoClassStateChanged()`.  That doesn't help either.

## How Does it Really Work?

In reality, `PseudoClass` is a lot easier to understand than you might think.  There's no magic, and it's really easy to use `PseudoClass`.

## Creating the PseudoClass

In the example code from the JavaDocs, the first part that's really important is the single line:

``` java
private static final PseudoClass
    MAGIC_PSEUDO_CLASS = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("xyzzy");
```

What does this do?

It does two things, one you can see, and one that you can't.

The first is to create an instance of `PseudoClass` as a static field.  Does it need to be static?  Technically, no, but as we'll see in a little bit, it's probably a good idea to implement it this way.

The second thing it does, which you cannot see, is that it updates a static `Map` deep inside `PseudoClass`, adding whatever name you used to initialize your `PseudoClass` - in this case, "xyzzy".  The `Map` makes sure that only one element with the same name exists in your application.  

If you try to instantiate another `PseudoClass` anywhere in your application with the same name, it will just reuse the `Map` entry it already has for that name.  That's not really a big deal, but you should avoid using names that are already defined in JavaFX, like "hover" or "disabled", because there might already be code that's going to be manipulating any `PseudoClasses` with that name.

## Setting the PseudoClass Value

The only other part of the example code you need to understand is this:

``` java
@Override protected void invalidated() {
    pseudoClassStateChanged(MAGIC_PSEUDO_CLASS, get());
}
```

Even this is too complicated.  You could use something like this:

``` java
    pseudoClassStateChanged(MAGIC_PSEUDO_CLASS, true);
```

What does this do?  `pseudoClassStateChanged()` is a method in `Node`.  You pass it a `PseudoClass`, and a new value (true or false) for that `PseudoClass` in that Node.  Under the hood, this method then adds or removes this `PseudoClass` to its list of active `PseudoClasses`.  In reality, this list is really just a list of the names that were given to the `PseudoClasses` when they were instantiated.

### Important Things to Know About PseudoClass

#### PseudoClass isn't part of the Node
The `PseudoClass` itself isn't installed into the `Node`, formally declared as part of it, or prepped in the `Node` in any special way at all.  You can instantiate a `PseudoClass` anywhere and pass it to any `Node`'s `pseudoClassStateChanged()` method, and it will work.  Furthermore, you can call a `Node's` `pseudoClassStateChanged()` from any number of places using completely different instances of a `PseudoClass` with the same name, and it will work exactly the same as if you had only used one instance of the same `PseudoClass` repeatedly.


#### Node.pseudoClassStateChanged() is a public method.  
This means that there's no need to extend any `Node` just to implement a `PseudoClass` on it.  You can manage the `PseudoClasses` on a `Node` from outside the `Node`.  This is absolutely not clear from the JavaDoc example.

#### The mechanism connecting PseudoClass to CSS isn't our concern
How the `Node` actually turns the list of active `PseudoClasses` into styling changes an your screen is something that we simply don't need to know.  As long as your CSS has the selectors defined, it will work.

#### PseudoClass itself isn't Reactive
It's important to note that `pseudoClassStateChanged()` itself has **NOTHING** to do with Properties or Bindings.  It's a plain vanilla Java method.  

#### PseudoClass instances aren't functionally unique
There is nothing particularly special or specific about any instance of `PseudoClass` other than its name and the way that names are managed.  The following code is perfectly fine:

``` java
    PseudoClass xyzzy = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("xyzzy");
    myButton.pseudoClassStateChanged(xyzzy, true);
```

It's probably a bit inefficient if it's going to be called a lot, just because there's a fair bit of code running inside of `PseudoClass.getPseudoClass()`.  So it might be best to declare it as a static field inside of whatever class holds this code.

# Connecting PseudoClasses to Properties and Bindings

So we've seen that `PseudoClasses` are just normal Java and are implemented through normal imperative programming techniques.  But if you want to build a reactive JavaFX application, then you need to control the `PseudoClasses` through `Properties` and `Bindings`.

How do you do that?

The way to connect imperative code to `Properties` is through `Invalidation Listeners`.  This is exactly what the example from the JavaDocs does, although it does it in the most complicated way possible.  

Essentially, what an `Invalidation Listener` does is to define a block of code that will run whenever the system decides that the value held in a property is no longer valid because it's potentially been changed, or some other properties that it's been bound to have changed.  Calling `get()` on the `Property` will cause it to recalculate it's value, but you can also run whatever other code you want in the `Listener`.  This is where you can call `Node.pseudoClassStateChanged()`.

The Property that you're listening to can be anything, anywhere.  It doesn't need to be a field in the `Node`, and it doesn't need to be a `BooleanProperty` either.  The `Listener` just needs to be defined in some scope that has access to both the `Node` and the `Property`.  The `Listener` would then contain whatever logic you need to turn a change in your `Property` value into a boolean value to be sent to `Node.pseudoClassStateChanged()`.

## A Simple Example

In this example, we're going to look at the "normal" use case for PseudoClass, a BooleanProperty which is part of the Model and which is connected to a PseudoClass through an `InvalidationListener`:

``` java
public class PseudoClassDemo extends Application {

    private BooleanProperty displayInRed = new SimpleBooleanProperty(false);

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 320, 240);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(PseudoClassDemo.class.getResource("test.css").toString());
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        PseudoClass redDisplay = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("red");
        Label label = new Label("This is the label text");
        displayInRed.addListener(inv -> {
            label.pseudoClassStateChanged(redDisplay, displayInRed.get());
        });
        Button button = new Button("Click Me");
        button.setOnAction(evt -> displayInRed.set(!displayInRed.get()));
        return new VBox(20, label, button);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }
}
```
Here's the CSS file for this:
``` css
.label:red {
   -fx-text-fill: red;
}
```
When it runs, it looks like this:

![Before Click](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/assets/elements/PseudoClass1.png)

After the `Button` is clicked, it looks like this:

![After Click](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/assets/elements/PseudoClass2.png)

I think this strips virtually all of the mystery out of `PseudoClass` creation.  It is possible to cut the `BooleanProperty` completely out of this if you want and call `label.pseudoClassStateChanged()` directly from the `Button` action - although this is not a good idea in terms of creating a Reactive JavaFX program:

``` java
public class PseudoClassDemo2 extends Application {

    private boolean showInRed = false;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 320, 240);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(PseudoClassDemo2.class.getResource("test.css").toString());
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        PseudoClass redDisplay = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("red");
        Label label = new Label("This is the label text");
        Button button = new Button("Click Me");
        button.setOnAction(evt -> {
            showInRed = !showInRed;
            label.pseudoClassStateChanged(redDisplay, showInRed);
        });
        return new VBox(20, label, button);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }
}
```
Once again, this isn't a good practice.  It's included here just to show how `PseudoClass`  is just regular Java code.

## A More Complicated Example

At this point, we're not really talking about `PseudoClass` itself any more, but about strategies around transforming non-boolean `Properties` into CSS pseudo-class changes.  

Let's look at how to turn a `StringProperty` into pseudo-class states:

``` java
public class PseudoClassDemo3 extends Application {

    private final StringProperty alertLevel = new SimpleStringProperty("Normal");

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 300, 100);
        scene.getStylesheets().add(PseudoClassDemo3.class.getResource("test.css").toString());
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        PseudoClass redDisplay = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("red");
        PseudoClass orangeDisplay = PseudoClass.getPseudoClass("orange");
        Label label = new Label("This is the label text");
        alertLevel.addListener(inv -> {
            label.pseudoClassStateChanged(redDisplay, false);
            label.pseudoClassStateChanged(orangeDisplay, false);
            switch (alertLevel.get()) {
                case "Warning" -> label.pseudoClassStateChanged(orangeDisplay, true);
                case "Emergency" -> label.pseudoClassStateChanged(redDisplay, true);
            }
        });
        return new VBox(20, label, createButtons());
    }

    private Node createButtons() {
        Button warningButton = new Button("Warning");
        warningButton.setOnAction(evt -> alertLevel.set("Warning"));
        Button emergencyButton = new Button("Emergency");
        emergencyButton.setOnAction(evt -> alertLevel.set("Emergency"));
        Button normalButton = new Button("All Clear");
        normalButton.setOnAction(evt -> alertLevel.set("All Clear"));
        return  new HBox(10, normalButton, warningButton, emergencyButton);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }
}
```

And the CSS file:

``` css
.label:red {
   -fx-text-fill: red;
}

.label:orange {
   -fx-text-fill: darkorange;
}
```

Which looks like this when the "Warning" button is clicked:

![After Click](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/assets/elements/PseudoClass3.png)

The `Buttons` just update the `StringProperty`, putting a new value into it.  The `StringProperty` has an `InvalidationListener` added to it, in a scope that has access to the `Label` so that the `InvalidationListener` can call its `pseudoClassStateChanged()` method.  

The `InvalidationListener` just turns off all of the custom `PseudoClasses` in the `Label`, and then uses a `switch` statement to turn on a specific `PseudoClass` depending on the value in the `StringProperty`.

# Conclusion

One good thing about the way that `PseudoClass` is introduced in the JavaDocs is that it reaffirms that the designers of JavaFX intended it to be used as a Reactive framework.  You can tell this because they take care to explain it in the context of a `BooleanProperty` embedded into a `Node`.

To be perfectly fair, though, the second sentence in the JavaDocs introduction is a complete and concise summary of everything in this tutorial:

>Introducing a pseudo-class into a JavaFX class only requires that the method Node.pseudoClassStateChanged(javafx.css.PseudoClass, boolean) be called when the pseudo-class state changes.

This tutorial is just one of a number of articles I've written about JavaFX.  You can find lots more at my website [www.pragmaticcoding.ca](http://www.pragmaticcoding.ca)

However, everything else in the JavaDocs makes it very difficult to believe it could be that simple.  Hopefully this tutorial has cleared that up.
