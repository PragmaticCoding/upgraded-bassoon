## JavaFX: All About Custom Bindings

# Introduction

There are three ways to create a `Binding`; the Fluent API, using the `Bindings` class builder methods and extending one of the abstract `Binding` classes to create a custom binding.  We're going to look at this last method in this article.

You should understand how to create your own custom Binding class just so that you understand how Bindings work internally.  This makes it much easier to understand how to use the builder method in the `Bindings` class - which you will probably use a lot.

# How This Fits in the JavaFX Hierarchy

## The Binding Interfaces
In JavaFX, `Binding` is an interface which extends `Observable`, and `ObservableValue`.  These two super-interfaces are important because they supply the `addListenter()`, and `removeListener()` methods for both InvalidationListeners and ChangeListeners.

`Bindings` themselves rely on `InvalidationListeners` to control their updates.  We'll see how this works.  In fact, the two main methods that the `Binding` interface adds are the `invalidate()` and `isValid` methods.  In practice, you'll rarely need to directly deal with either of those methods.

## The Abstract Classes
In practice, virtually all custom `Binding` classes are created by extending one of the abstract `Binding` classes contained in the JavaFX library.  These are all designed to handle bindings on different types of data.  There is `BooleanBinding`, `DoubleBinding`, `IntegerBinding`, `ListBinding`, `LongBinding`, `MapBinding`, `ObjectBinding`, `SetBinding`, and `StringBinding`.

In general, all of these abstract classes are similar, differing only in the data types that they are concerned with.  The Binding classes for collections have some additional methods that relate to aspects of collections, such as size or "empty". Also, all of these classes implement observable interfaces for their data types.  So, an `IntegerBinding` implements `ObservableIntegerValue`.

Since they implement Binding, they will implement methods for `addListener()` (for both `InvalidationListeners`, and `ChangeListeners`).  The `bind()` method for all of these classes is protected, so you cannot call it from your layout code - meaning that your bound dependencies need to be defined at the time that you instantiate the `Binding`.

# The `computeValue()` Method

The vast majority of the time, all of the code that you write for a custom `Binding` class will be it's constructor and the `computeValue()` method.  The `computeValue()` method is abstract in all of these classes, so it's mandatory when you define your own class.  You'll need to call the protected `bind()` method from the parent abstract class, and the only place to do that is generally the constructor.

The `computeValue()` method is also protected.  It's called from the public `get()` method, and it returns the data type encapsulated by the `Binding` class.  So a class extending `IntegerBinding` will return `int` from both its `get()` and `computeValue()` methods.  

This is very important to understand:  The Binding itself is all about linking `Observable` values and `Properties`, but the `computeValue()` method is concerned about the underlying data type of the binding.  It can calculate its return value from anywhere, and it generally deals with normal Java data types and classes.

# An Example

Now, let's look at an example:

``` java
public class CustomBindingDemo extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 620, 340);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        ObjectProperty<Integer> number1 = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(100);
        ObjectProperty<Integer> number2 = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(30);
        BooleanProperty evensOnly = new SimpleBooleanProperty(false);
        Label label1 = new Label();
        label1.textProperty().bind(number1.asString());
        Label label2 = new Label();
        label2.textProperty().bind(number2.asString());posts
        Label results = new Label();
        results.textProperty().bind(new CustomIntegerBinding(number1, number2, evensOnly).asString());
        HBox labelBox = new HBox(10,
                new Label("Number 1:"), label1,
                new Label("Number2: "), label2,
                new Label("Results: "), results);
        Button button1 = new Button("Increase Value 1");
        button1.setOnAction(evt -> number1.set(number1.get() + 1));
        Button button2 = new Button("Increase Value 2");
        button2.setOnAction(evt -> number2.set(number2.get() + 1));
        CheckBox checkBox = new CheckBox("Evens Only");
        evensOnly.bind(checkBox.selectedProperty());
        HBox controlBox = new HBox(5, button1, button2, checkBox);
        VBox vBox = new VBox(40, labelBox, controlBox);
        vBox.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        return vBox;
    }
}

class CustomIntegerBinding extends IntegerBinding {

    private final ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property1;
    private final ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property2;
    private final ObservableBooleanValue evenOnly;
    private int divisor = 1;

    public CustomIntegerBinding(ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property1, ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property2, ObservableBooleanValue evenOnly) {
        super.bind(property1, property2, evenOnly);
        this.property1 = property1;
        this.property2 = property2;
        this.evenOnly = evenOnly;
    }

    @Override
    protected int computeValue() {
        int result = (property1.get() + property2.get()) / divisor;
        System.out.println("computing " + property1.get() + " " + property2.get() + " divisor: " + divisor + " result: " + result);
        divisor++;
        if (evenOnly.get()) {
            return ((result % 2) == 0) ? result : 0;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
This is a bit goofy, and it certainly doesn't do anything too useful, but it does demonstrate all the key points you need to understand about custom bindings.  When it runs, it looks like this:


![CustomBinding.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648046988248/mLTNmgF0a.png)

and the console output looks like this:

```
computing 100 30 divisor: 1 result: 130
computing 100 30 divisor: 2 result: 65
computing 101 30 divisor: 3 result: 43
computing 102 30 divisor: 4 result: 33
computing 102 31 divisor: 5 result: 26
computing 102 32 divisor: 6 result: 22
computing 102 33 divisor: 7 result: 19
computing 102 33 divisor: 8 result: 16
computing 103 33 divisor: 9 result: 15
computing 104 33 divisor: 10 result: 13
computing 105 33 divisor: 11 result: 12
```

## The Layout Code
Here we have three `Property` variables instantiated, which together are the Model for this application.  Two are `Integer` properties used as counters, and the third is a `Boolean` property.  So that we can see the results, we have a set of Labels in a row, the first two of which are bound to our counter properties, and the last is bound to our custom binding.

There are two `Buttons` and a `CheckBox` in a second row.  Each `Button` increments one of the counter properties, and the `CheckBox` is bound to the `Boolean` property.  

## The Custom Binding

This custom `Binding` extends `IntegerBinding`, so its `get()` and `computeValue()` are going to return `int`.  Since this is an externally declared class, we need to create fields for all of the dependency properties, and they need to be passed in the constructor.  That's pretty much all that the constructor does; initialize the fields and call `super.bind()`.

The call to `super.bind()` is going to register each of these properties with `IntegerBinding` so that they are monitored and will invalidate the `Binding` when one of them changes.  This invalidation will trigger whatever `Properties` that this `Binding` is bound to to call the `get()` method, which will in turn call the `computeValue()` method.

There's also a private `int` field in the Binding called `divisor`.  This is there to show that this is just an ordinary class, and `computeValue()` is just an ordinary method like any other.  

What does `computeValue()` do?  Basically, it adds the current values of both Integer properties together, and then divides them by the `divisor`, which it then increments by one.  If the `Boolean` property is true then it checks to see if the result is even or odd, and if it's odd, it returns zero instead.

# About Invalidation

At this point we need to talk about Invalidation and how it relates to `Bindings`.

## What is it?

Every `Observable` has two data elements:  The observed value and a `Valid` boolean.  The `Valid` boolean signals whether or not the observed value has changed since the last time it was accessed, with `true` meaning that the last value accessed is still valid.  When you set a listener on an Observable, what you're really doing is asking to be notified whenever the `Valid` value changes to "false".  In other words, we're listening for when the value becomes "invalid" or, if you like, has been "invalidated".

## Resetting Validation

This is super important:  The only way to re-validate an Observable is to call the *get()* method of the Observable.

Think about those `Labels` in the sample code.  They are bound to the `IntegerProperties`.  There's a lot of functionality that we don't see (or really care about), behind `Label`.  It needs to take the data from its `Text` property and turn it into pixels on the screen.  Somewhere in there, there's going to be an `InvalidationListener` on that `Text` property, and that listener is going to call the property's `get()` method.

In turn, the property is going to call the binding's `get()` method, which in turn is going to call the `get()` method of the `IntegerProperty`.  And all three elements are going to have their `Valid` field set to `true`.


## Invalidating an Observable

A property can become invalidated in two ways:  The `set()` method can be called on it or the `Observable` that it's been bound to has become invalidated.  Since a bound Property cannot be `set()`, only one of these two reasons can ever apply to a `Property` at any given time.

`Bindings` can only become invalidated when one of their bound dependencies becomes invalidated.  In turn, any `Observables` that are bound to this `Binding` will also become invalidated.

What you're seeing is that calling `super.bind()` in your custom `Binding` simply creates an `InvalidationListener` on each bound dependency which does nothing except invalidate your custom `Binding`.  Any `InvalidationListener` on your `Binding` will be notified of the change.

This is super, super important:  A Binding that's already invalidated cannot be invalidated again until it's reset.


## The Big "Gotcha" With Custom Bindings

While it's true that the `computeValue()` method of a Binding can perform its calculation any way it wants and doesn't have to use any value from its bound dependencies, you really need to make sure that you call the `get()` method of every bound dependency inside `computeValue()`.

Why?

Because you need to re-validate all of those bound dependencies.  The `InvalidationListeners` are only going to trigger once when the `Observable` is invalidated.  If it's not re-validated before its value is changed again, it's already invalidated and won't trigger the `InvalidationListeners` a second time.

Everyone who's created enough custom `Bindings` has fallen into this trap at least once.  It usually happens when you have `Bindings` dependent on other `Bindings` so that it obscures where the problem is.  Then, Poof!  Three hours of your life are gone trying to figure out why the `Binding` updates sometimes but not others.

### An Example of Not Re-validating

Here's the first example modified to remove all of the `get()` calls on the `number2` property:

``` java
public class CustomBindingDemo2 extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 620, 340);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        AtomicInteger number2Value = new AtomicInteger(30);
        ObjectProperty<Integer> number1 = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(100);
        ObjectProperty<Integer> number2 = new SimpleObjectProperty<>(number2Value.get());
        Label label1 = new Label();
        label1.textProperty().bind(number1.asString());
        Label results = new Label();
        results.textProperty().bind(new CustomIntegerBinding2(number1, number2).asString());
        HBox labelBox = new HBox(10,
                new Label("Number 1:"), label1,
                new Label("Results: "), results);
        Button button1 = new Button("Increase Value 1");
        button1.setOnAction(evt -> number1.set(number1.get() + 1));
        Button button2 = new Button("Increase Value 2");
        button2.setOnAction(evt -> number2.set(number2Value.incrementAndGet()));
        HBox controlBox = new HBox(5, button1, button2);
        VBox vBox = new VBox(40, labelBox, controlBox);
        vBox.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        return vBox;
    }
}

class CustomIntegerBinding2 extends IntegerBinding {

    private final ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property1;
    private int divisor = 1;

    public CustomIntegerBinding2(ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property1, ObservableObjectValue<Integer> property2) {
        super.bind(property1, property2);
        this.property1 = property1;
    }

    @Override
    protected int computeValue() {
        System.out.println("computing " + property1.get() + "divisor: " + divisor);
        return property1.get() / divisor++;
    }
}
```

The `computeValue()` method has been changed so that it only uses `number1` and `divisor`, while the Binding itself still has a dependency on `number2`.

The `Label` showing the value of `number2` has been removed because it was automatically calling `get()` on `number2`, and re-validating the `Property`.  Finally, the action in `button2` has been changed because it was calling `number2.get()` in order to change it.  So a separate counter, `number2Value` was introduced so it's no longer necessary to call `number2.get()` in order to increment it.

Finally, the `BooleanProperty` has been removed since we're done with it.

Now, when you click on `button1` the `computeValue()` method will be called every time.  But after the first click of `button2`, which invalidates `number2`, it won't have any impact on the screen any more.  The value in the `Property` will change, but it won't cause the custom binding to invalidate, because `number2` has already been invalidated and there's no code in the program to re-validate it.

# Binding Lists

Creating `Bindings` that calculate totals and averages, or which find the minimum or maximum of an `ObservableList` appears to be very difficult to do at first.  It's nearly impossible if you're just using the Fluent API for binding, but actually quite easy with a custom `Binding` class.  

Here we're going to calculate the total of an `ObservableList<Integer>` which is loaded into a `ListView`:

``` java
public class CustomBindingDemo3 extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 620, 340);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        Random numberGenerator = new Random();
        ObservableList<Integer> theList = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
        for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
            theList.add(numberGenerator.nextInt(101));
        }
        ListView<Integer> listView = new ListView<>();
        listView.setItems(theList);
        Label results = new Label("");
        results.textProperty().bind(new CustomIntegerBinding3(theList).asString());
        HBox labelBox = new HBox(10, new Label("Total: "), results);
        Button button1 = new Button("Add Value");
        button1.setOnAction(evt -> theList.add(numberGenerator.nextInt(101)));
        VBox vBox = new VBox(10, listView, labelBox, button1);
        vBox.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        return vBox;
    }
}

class CustomIntegerBinding3 extends IntegerBinding {

    ObservableList<Integer> theList;

    public CustomIntegerBinding3(ObservableList<Integer> theList) {
        super.bind(theList);
        this.theList = theList;
    }

    @Override
    protected int computeValue() {
        System.out.println("computing " + theList.size());
        return theList.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
    }
}
```
It looks something like this:


![ListBinding.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648047151834/GU_iw_7sP.png)

On the screen we have a `ListView`, a couple of `Labels` and a `Button`.  The `Button` generates a new random number and adds it to the `ObservableList`.  One of the `Labels` is bound to a custom `Binding` that calculates the total of values in the `ObservableList`.  So when the `Button` is clicked, the `ObservableList` becomes invalidated, which invalidates the custom `Binding` and triggers the `Label` to call `CustomIntegerBinding3.get()`, which invokes its `computeValue()` method.

The calculation inside `computeValue()` is trivial; stream through the List and add up all the values.

# Custom Bindings as Anonymous Inner Classes

This is probably the most common way that you'll use custom Bindings.  

Anonymous Inner Classes have the advantage that you can access any variable or field which is available in the scope in which they are created, but the limitation that you can't use a constructor with parameters.  For custom `Bindings`, you still need to implement the default constructor because you have to call `super.bind()`.

Here's the previous List binding example, but rewritten as an anonymous inner class:

``` java
public class CustomBindingDemo4 extends Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch();
    }

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        Scene scene = new Scene(createContent(), 620, 340);
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    private Region createContent() {
        Random numberGenerator = new Random();
        ObservableList<Integer> theList = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
        for (int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
            theList.add(numberGenerator.nextInt(101));
        }
        IntegerBinding customListBinding = new IntegerBinding() {
            {
                super.bind(theList);
            }

            @Override
            protected int computeValue() {
                System.out.println("computing " + theList.size());
                return theList.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
            }
        };
        ListView<Integer> listView = new ListView<>();
        listView.setItems(theList);
        Label results = new Label("");
        results.textProperty().bind(customListBinding.asString());
        HBox labelBox = new HBox(10, new Label("Total: "), results);
        Button button1 = new Button("Add Value");
        button1.setOnAction(evt -> theList.add(numberGenerator.nextInt(101)));
        VBox vBox = new VBox(10, listView, labelBox, button1);
        vBox.setPadding(new Insets(30));
        return vBox;
    }
}
```
Once again, it's fairly trivial and looks almost the same as the external custom Binding.  There's no need to create a field for `ObservableList`, since it's available in the scope in which the `Binding` is created, so it can be directly referenced.

There is the slightly strange looking hanging `{}`, which is the Java way of defining default constructors for anonymous inner classes, and it does nothing other than call `super.bind()` to set `theList` as a bound dependency for the Binding.

## Something to Watch Out For

Since anonymous inner classes have access to all the fields and local variables in their scope, it can be very tempting to just access any of these in `computeValue()`.  However, if any of those fields or variables are mutable and they are NOT set as bound dependencies for the Binding, then changes in them will NOT trigger invalidation of your Binding.

Changes to those variables will be reflected in the value returned by `computeValue()` the next time that it is called, but that will only happen when one of the bound dependencies becomes invalidated.
